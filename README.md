Kubernetes Orchestration for a Multi-Language Microservice Application

## Introduction:

This project showcases an orchestration of a multi-language microservice architecture using Kubernetes with Minikube. It features the utilization of Docker for containerizing each service, including a Next.js frontend with server-side rendering (SSR), Node.js for backend services, and Golang powered by the Gin framework. The project incorporates a range of technologies and design patterns, such as Typescript, the Atomic Design pattern for UI development, and Redux Slice for efficient state management. In terms of database interactions, it employs MongoDB alongside GraphQL. The primary objective is to illustrate the deployment, scalability, and structural aspects of a complex application within a unified Kubernetes environment.
